# Serverless Firebase Development: [Challenge Lab](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/14677?parent=catalog)

## Challenge scenario
In this lab you will create a frontend solution using a Rest API and Firestore database. Cloud Firestore is a NoSQL document database that is part of the Firebase platform where you can store, sync, and query data for your mobile and web apps at scale. Lab content is based on resolving a real world scenario through the use of Google Cloud serverless infrastructure.
