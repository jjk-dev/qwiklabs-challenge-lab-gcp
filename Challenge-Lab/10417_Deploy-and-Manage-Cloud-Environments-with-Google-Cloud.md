# Deploy and Manage Cloud Environments with Google Cloud: [Challenge Lab](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/10417?parent=catalog)

## Challenge scenario
You have started a new role as a Cloud Architect for Jooli Inc. You are expected to help design and manage the infrastructure at Jooli. Common tasks revolve around designing environments for the various projects within the Jooli Inc. family but also include provisioning resources for projects.

You are expected to have the skills and knowledge for these tasks, so don't expect step-by-step guides.

You have been asked to assist the kraken team complete setting up their product development environment. The previous Cloud Architect working with the kraken team was unfortunately too curious about if krakens were real or not, and has gone missing after venturing out into the open sea last weekend in search of such a beast.

Jooli Inc. management has supreme faith in your abilities, don't let them down! (Seriously, they don't need the dates to slip further).

The kraken team are building a next generation tool and they will host the application on Kubernetes. The project source code is stored in Cloud Source Repositories, with Spinnaker building and deploying any changes into the build Kubernetes environment.
- Create the Production Environment
- Setup the Admin instance
- Verify the Spinnaker deployment

Some standards you should follow:
- Create all resources in the **us-east1** region and **us-east1-b** zone, unless otherwise directed.
- Use the project VPCs.
- Naming is normally team-resource, e.g. an instance could be named **kraken-webserver1**
- Allocate cost effective resource sizes. Projects are monitored and excessive resource use will result in the containing project's termination (and possibly yours), so beware. This is the guidance the monitoring team is willing to share; unless directed, use **f1-micro** for small Linux VMs and **n1-standard-1** for Windows or other applications such as Kubernetes nodes.
